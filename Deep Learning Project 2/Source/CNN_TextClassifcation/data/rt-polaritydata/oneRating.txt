Don't buy Nike sneakers if you want to return or exchange them.. I've bought many from them. I went this week  and bought 2 pairs of Nike SB's that were already over retail price as it is.. I tried on one side then bought them... When I got home I realized that one of the shoes were damaged.. It's only been 2 days and they said they can't take it back.. I've bought many shoes there and this will be the last time... I'm from Nor Cal and people are crazy about sneakers out there and all the shops will accept a return or exchanged within 14- 30 days.. This was the first place that does not do that.. Why? Because sneakers and SB's are not big in AZ... They don't sell here.. I wouldn't buy them there if I were you.
"""I don't even know where to begin - this place is downright awful. From quality of 'management' to condition of the rooms, Motel 6 Scottsdale is truly a dump of a hotel in every sense of the word. Not only was my bed infested with living bugs, but the shower was broken, and green mold was all over the baseboard. When I asked the 'manager on duty' (heavy set, tattooed gentlemen named Michael) if he was aware that his rooms were infested with insects, he started laughing and accused me of making the whole thing up. I proceeded to return to my hotel room to photograph the bugs to prove I was being truthful. Michael continued to giggle and said \Sorry, nothing I can do.\"""" I then demanded my money back, which Michael initially refused to offer. He finally refunded my money after I threatened to take Motel 6 to small claims court. All I can say is, whoever the 'real' GM of this particular Motel 6 is - you need to take a long hard look at the quality of employees you hire. This experience will keep me from staying at any Motel 6 ever again."""""""
"""oyy a miss for me on this one! \n\nI heard about Nourish a few weeks ago and have been meaning to try it...I happened to be in the nabe yesterday early evening and decided to go in. The place is huge but was completely empty...we were welcomed nicely. \n\nIt is vegetarian, vegan, lactose and gluten-free...the menu looked AWESOME - lots of options and great concepts... as I was looking it over, I was already drafting an enthusiastic e-mail in my mind to all my friends who happen to be vegetarian and vegan...and then I saw the note that stands on each table enumerating what nourish is all about:\n\n\everything only sweetened with agave nectar\"""" (omg must come here for lunch tomorrow)\n\n\""""coconut milk instead of cream\"""" (omg Chrissy's bday party must happen here!!)\n\n\""""our sweet potato fries our air fried no oil! (July 4th weekend at Nourish!!)\n\nI was having a pretty good time in my head until the food arrived...\nwe started with the garlic/artichoke hummus:\ndisappointing: it was very small and came with three pieces of sad, wilted old and dirty looking cucumbers and carrots. Surprising as a veggie place you would think that the focus would be on the vegetables being fresh, colorful and appetizing! not so!\n\nnext the \""""kitchen sink\"""" salad with grilled chicken - again a huge miss!  veggies were old, wilted and just sad - chicken was NOT grilled rather that white/diced chicken thing with the bad after taste yuck! (I know its not the most original choice but IT IS a veggie place after all so I thought the salad would be the star...too bad it didn't even get into the local theatre school!!!)\n\nmy husband ordered the garlic/lemon chicken on quinoa salad - more flavorful than mine... but SO small! yes that's another thing.. the portions are tiny - the entree portions look like appetizers...\n\nThings went from bad to worse when our waitress started ignoring us towards the end... I was still hungry after my sad salad so I ordered some of them air fried sweet potato fries... ehhh... and I asked for some ketchup and it took her 1/2 hour to get it to me - she came out six times - yup SIX doing other errands before she got me my ketchup even though we were practically the only ones in the place...\n\nby the time we paid our check... my \"""" imaginary\"""" e-mail to my friends  went from enthusiastic to delete!\n\nI'll \""""nourish\"""" myself elsewhere thank you... dinner  and \""""bachelorette\"""" at my place???"""""""
"""\Living History\"""" in the title is false advertising. We went today and the place was DEAD. There were no re-enactors at all, short of the blacksmith who kept to his forge and a random guy wandering around with an eye patch and a flannel shirt who didn't acknowledge us.\n\nEVERYTHING (except the blacksmith's) was closed off. No gun fights (the nearby shooting range gave us a false hope when we had gotten out of the car), no demos, no people in costume, NOTHING. Even the pigs and chickens near the Northern House were out of sight. \n\nThe buildings were fairly dilapidated, which isn't surprising. But bees and wasps were living in the dried mud of the structures. BEWARE.  \n\nComparing this place to Rawhide isn't quite fair considering the fact that Rawhide's pretty much a set and it's designed for kids. Goldfield would be a closer comparison since it actually looks like a ghosttown with people in costume. At least with those locations you didn't pay anything to pretty much wander around an empty town. At both Goldfield and Rawhide, most things are all in one area with many shops, vendors, activities, people to interact with, and things to see. \n\nNOT SO with Pioneer Village. I might be biased because I also had an injured leg, but everything was spread out. You would walk for 10-15 minutes to a far off building just to stare in the windows at pretty much nothing.  \n\nI really wanted my $7 back. When we approached the girl in the giftshop who was also taking money for admission, she kept giving us a sob story/guilt trip about the economy being bad. If they're all volunteers (all 3 of them) as she said they were, why charge just to walk around and not get to interact with anyone? RIP-OFF. \n\nIf there isn't anything to see but the buildings, no shows or anything, it should be pay-what-you-can/donation at best. \n\nI was going to give this 2 stars out of pity, but at this point even 1 star is generous."""""""
Rating the golf course, horrible!!  Thank goodness there was no one in front of us and we zipped around the course.  They clearly stopped maintaining the course.  Bunkers are concrete, after a few times in them I decided to take it out and not bother hitting it.  No grass around the greens and the greens couldn't hold the ball worth a darn.  One green did have gravel on it, I putted the ball and it wiggled all over the place.  I'm glad I only played there for 15 bucks, which included the golfnow fee.  If your a horrible golfer I'd play there.
"""I would never go back.  It isn't anything special... it is just a store space with a bar and like 4 tables.  The DJ is HORRIBLE!!!

The drinks are watered down and over priced (so unusual for Snotsdale, I know) and the waitresses and bartenders and BIIIIIIITCHES!!

My husband and I really wanted to check out this office because it is the closest to us. We had no problem making the appointment for doctor interview at 7:30 a.m., to meet the doctor and promptly showed up at the time of the appointment just to find out that the doctor was not there. In a brief conversation where we stated that we are going to wait until doctor shows up, we were told that we can't meet with doctor regardless of the appointment. Before we could even react office manager Marry Summers informed us that we cannot talked with other doctors, and what we were told is not true. I have to emphasize that Mary Summers was not nice, apologetic, and empathetic about our situation at all. She just wanted us out of the office. I know that everybody has a bad morning, but she was letting it shine. \nMary continued with this; You were informed wrong, and what I am telling you is how it is; You don't need anybody's name but mine; Other people choose the doctor by reading the bio online; This is my office policy.......on and on and on Mary continued to cut us, and see us on the way out.\n \nMaybe those doctors in the office are nice, but why would I bother going through this office representation when even the doctor were not there for their appointment, and I would not see them even if I would wait.....\n\nTo all of you that still wish to try this office, I really wish you good luck.
This place sucks! The owner waited on us and her frizzy nasty hair was hanging down and all over the place. I guess because she had a hat on it was ok YUCK beside that she is a terrible waitress and this is the second time she has waited on us. The prime rib was the absolute worst we have ever had, the mac and cheese was pasta with milk no flavor at all. The owners kid runs around, screams and acts like a heathen and they think its cute and thats what paying customers want to experience when they go in there. We wont be spending anymore money in that place.
I was about to give 2 stars for the baba ganoush, pita, moussaka, and some shredded meat dish that were good. This was despite the many dishes that were very strange. By strange I mean not good....what is this???? and why would this taste this way??? I am not sure how one could mess up penne pasta with Greek dressing or orzo pasta but they managed to make it inedible. Many things looked pretty dry and maybe not from today. The cook staff loading things in using their fingers is a little unappetizing too. Like another review said, maybe they could make it if they took out two buffets and just had two. Then they could focus on the better dishes. The straw that made them get 1 instead of 2 stars was that they charge you $1 for each tap water they serve your table.... Really? $6 for tap water for our table. I admit I am very picky but my husband is not. His motto is quantity over quality. And he said we will not go back. I would rather have one dish cost $10 or more and have it be really good than have 70 ok or inedible dishes. I hope to hear that they shorten the buffet and focus on quality. Oh and the chocolate pudding was spoiled. ;(
"""The folks at Tapino need to buy a dictionary and look up the word \Hospitality\"""".  I have never been so offended in my life as a patron of a restaurant.

BEWARE!!!!  I was taken advantage of by Joe and this man lacks honesty.  I had to arrive with the police to retrieve a table he was supposed to call me with an estimate to restore and come to an agreement about a price to sell it.  Instead I received a check in the mail for $250 with a note that he sold it!!!  It was still in his store for a price tag of $1,200 and he was untruthful about even that to the police.  How very sad it took the police to make things right with this dishonest fellow!
"""I really doubt Down Under will welcome my review, but I HAVE to do it just to get this off my chest. \n\nI spent a very long and frustrating hour+ this morning on the patio with my dog and some friends. My dog, Peekaboo seemed to enjoy it, but I HATED it! \n\nThere was a \Doggie Day Sunday brunch on the patio\"""" event going on on. I had scheduled a FindMyDogADate AZ Meetup there for this doggie event. All of the tables and chairs were taken when I arrived by the people running their doggie event tables. Eventually I found a table with two wet chairs directly under the very wet misters. (It's no wonder no one wanted to sit there). Since I had four other people coming, I scrounged up more chairs. All of them were directly under the dripping misters.\n\nAfter my friends arrived, I went inside to grab some brunch. They were charging a ridiculous $12 for rubbery whatever that was, cold eggs, rock hard pancakes and a tiny dish of grapes served by a lady who couldn't even tell me the price of the brunch. The orange juice was extra so I asked for a glass of water. I got a plate full of yuck, sat down in the wet chair while the water dripped on my plate of yuck making it even yuckier. I took my uneaten plate back after one bite and told them I would go eat at McDonald's. YUCK!!\n\nThe patio needs to be condemned! I was tempted to call the health inspector! Dogs had pooped on the gravel behind the tables and it wasn't cleaned up. No doggie poop bags were to be found anywhere. Luckily I had brought some with me. After cleaning it up, there weren't any trash cans available to dispose of it!!! \n\nThe \""""waitress\"""" never stopped by our table the entire time!\n\nAll on all it was a very dirty and disappointing experience.

This was one of the worst meals ever. \n\nWe went because my wife received some giftcards from a patients family at the hospital she works at. \n\nThe service was lousy but the food was worse. Bland, uninspired and came cold to boot. They don't have garlic bread? I got a lame excuse for why. I grew up in NY. This is not italian food. A manger stopped by and asked how everything was and we said ok. All she had to do was look at our uneaten plates to know. I really didn't want to complain because I didn't want anything else from them. I just wanted to leave. \n\nWhen we got home I realized that the nice people who had gone out of their way to give my wife a $100 gift card were just ripped off. I wrote to the company to let them know of my experience and have never heard back.  \n\nI have managed and worked at restaurants for over 25 years. I understand it's a tough job. Mistakes happen, but you should address them. \n\nI usually don't complain, I just never go back. This was well beyond bad and the lack of follow up on a guests lousy experience speaks volumes. I will never darken the door of any of the OSI Restaurant Partners establishments (Outback, Fleming's, Roy's, Bonefish) if that's how they treat their guests.\n\nCaveat emptor.

I dated a guy once who told me that Chinese food is like pizza because you can't really mess it up.  Well, the next time I run into him, I am going to send him to Jimmy Woo's.  \n\nFor the last few weeks, I have had a weird craving for Chinese food, and just in case you are wondering, I'm not pregnant.  I decided to give Jimmy Woo's a try today since I drive by the place every day, and I am not a fan of P.F. Chang's across the street.  \n\nWow. That was a mistake.  \n\nI ordered some noodles and pork dumplings, and I was shocked by how BLAND the food was.  If I could chew and swallow air, I think it would taste like the food I got today.  The pork had huge chunks of tendon within it that I couldn't eat half of the meat, and the sauce was so tasteless that I had to put some soy sauce on it which I absolutely hate doing.  Since my craving hasn't been satisfied by this experience, I am going to drive out to Chandler or Phoenix tonight for Chinese food praying for better.
I just had dinner here tonight and ordered a side of steamed vegetables for my 15 month old daughter, when our entrees came out I had to ask twice for the steamed vegetables, after several minutes the waiter came back and told me that I could have grilled zucchini or red peppers only and that the executive chef said that was all that was available and they could not do steamed vegetables. I an age where many people have dietary requirements that is never ending a simple request for steamed vegetables is refused. You can bet your bottom dollar I will never recommend this chain to anyone. I can only hope if you have allergies you are very careful at this restaurant as judging from my experience you could end up very sick or in hospital due to the non flexibility of the kitchen and chef.
"""Consider yourself warned, do not take your vehicle here! Had a problem with a vehicle and had it towed to Greulich's. The next morning I got a call from one of the \mechanics\"""" telling me that he could not get into the vehicle because the key wouldn't work. I explained that this was because had had the ignition replaced (by them) a year earlier, and that the door key was different from the ignition, and that we always used the key fob to unlock the doors. He explained that the fob wasn't unlocking the doors, and asked if I could bring down the door keys. I agreed to do so, but suggested that he check the battery first. He agreed to do so, and said he would call if he needed me to come down with the key. Later that day another \""""mechanic\"""" called me with an estimate of repairs that included a new window actuator (an extra $200+) that needed to be replaced because the window was broken and stuck in the rolled down position. I explained that this was not the case when it was towed in, and that the other mechanic had called because he could not get in to the vehicle, which he would have obviously been able to do if the window was down. To this, the mechanic replied that there must have been a \""""miscommunication\"""" because the window was down when it had been towed in. I asked him why then had the other mechanic not been able to get into a vehicle with an open window, to which he stammered \""""uhh, umm, he never actually went out to the vehicle, and umm, never noticed the window was open.\"""" I asked him how he knew that the key didn't work if he didn't go out to the vehicle, to which he said that \""""well....uhh... he did go out, but didn't notice the window was down.\"""" I almost fell off my chair, \""""who do you have working for you?\"""" I asked incredulously. It didn't matter, the mechanic was holding to his story, and I could either pay to fix the window that they OBVIOUSLY broke when trying to get in to the vehicle, or spend a bunch of time arguing and fighting it. I decided to not give them the satisfaction (and extra money)  and had it repaired at another place. I have since complained to AAA and the BBB. Stay away!"""""""
Totally forgot to Yelp about the fat chick behind the bar that apparently is pretty bitter about not being let on stage. Opened up a tab (She also required my ID) and when I went back for round two she didn't remember me and had lost my credit card and my driver's license. Obviously not wanting to be wrong she calls over her trusty meathead who kicks me out of the club without discussion. So I stand outside refusing to leave until I get my stuff back and eventually a bouncer comes out, doesn't apologize, and hands me my cards. I realize these people deal with scumbags all the time but I had barely finished my first drink before they booted me out for demanding that someone return to me what was mine. I'll probably go back but I'll definitely need to bring some Taco Bell in a horse feed bag to bribe/distract that thing behind the bar while I enjoy my night.

Disappointing to say the least....\nThis is my 4th time here and I wouldn;t have gone here so many times if it wasn't the proximity to MCC. Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.\n This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.\n\nNote to self: Never venture here again
to start with i went with my boyfriend at 330 on 9/10/11. there were only 5 tables of people there including us. after sitting down i realized the cushion was covered in chip crumbs and lettuce, clearly they had not been wiped off. after ordering the server Joe D didnt ask if i needed a straw or lemon for my water. then my boyfriend had to wait 10 minutes to get a refill on his pepsi. when i looked around i saw Joe D standing at the bar slurping from his drink while talking to the guy behind the bar. The table next to me were served burnt chips. when we got the food my chicken was dry. this place sucks! i had been there before about 10 years ago and it was great back then. lastly this company has no comment cards anywhere in the restaurant nor do they have a way to contact the restaurant or make complaints through the website. they must not care about their customers as much as they use to. i do not recommend. if you are looking for mexican there are better places in the central/biltmore area. the only good thing was the red sauce on the chimi but not enough to get me back.
"""Went here for a quick bite with family before a play at Phoenix Theater.  I was hesitant based on the reviews here about cleanliness and mediocre food, but the place is a local legend and we had to give it a try.  On the way to our booth, we passed a large empty table that still had the messy remains of previous diners and wondered why the not-busy-at-all waitstaff hadn't cleaned it up yet. The food was on the high side of \just OK.\""""  The malt, ice-cream soda, and phosphates we ordered with dinner were fantastic.  But, before the final curtain of the show, the cramping began for what would be a 24-hour bout of food poisoning traced back - by process of elimination - to McAlpines chicken salad.  I suppose if you want a delicious soda fountain treat, this is your place.  If you want to eat diner food without getting sick, go somewhere else."""""""
The ID I provided to the TSA was STILL not enough to get a drink here. We would have stayed, but their prices are ridiculous, so we walked up to FOX. They were far busier and it is obviously for a reason. They happily accepted my ID here and we ate and drank our way through a rather long layover.\n\n\nThis place stinks, even for an airport bar. Avoid at all possible costs. Only gave 1 star because I had to.
This was my first visit to this new location of OSF in the chandler mall, and I'll tell you right now, I don't know if the other locations are this bad, but I will not be returning... If you're wondering why, read on, you'll see.\n\n\n---Service---\nWe had a table of 10, which i understand can be difficult, but in a restaurant this big that seats probably 150 people or so, they shouldn't have trouble with a table of 10. We were seated promptly enough, and our waitress took drink orders while we were still waiting for half of our crew. Once everyone else showed up she took their orders, but completely forgot my friend. He eventually got a water, but by that time we were about half way done with our meal. When the food that we ordered arrived, my friend who didn't get a drink also didn't get his entr\u00e9e. It came out about 5 minutes after everyone elses. My wife and I ordered garlic cheese bread as an appetizer and we didn't get it until 10 minutes after we were done eating dinner. The waitress said the kitchen was backed up, which I don't buy at all. She simply forgot to place the order until i mentioned it was missing, plain and simple. When the bill came we noticed that the two drinks we ordered were missing from the tab and we notified the waitress of her mistake. What she should have done was apologize for the poor service and numerous mistakes she made and comp'd the drinks and the garlic bread, but instead she corrected her mistake and she threw away an opportunity win some brownies points and any kind of a reasonable tip. Sadly, this had to be some of the worst service I've received at a restaurant in recent history.\n\n\n---Atmosphere----\nAs far as the restaurant itself is concerned, they did a really good job converting a rather eclectic Mexican place into a nicely furnished and modern feeling Italian joint. Our party was seated closer to the front of the restaurant, and because they left the outer doors of the two doored entry way wide open, whenever anybody would come inside there was a giant gush of cold air that would sweep in, making everyone at my table cold while trying to enjoy out no-longer-hot food. What's the point of having two entry doors if you leave the outside doors wide open!! Seriously people. It was pretty noisy and chaotic inside as well. All the waiters and waitresses seemed to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The nature of the building also lends itself to being acoustically boisterous, that is to say, this isn't the place to come if you're in the mood for a quiet dinner with your loved one. \n\n\n----Quality----\nNone of this even speaks to the quality of the food, which is to say, quite sub par considering the prices on the menu. My wife and I ordered the whole wheat spaghetti with mushrooms and marinara sauce. The portion size was smaller than average for a $10 plate, and the sauce was way to wet and there was way to much of it. My spaghetti was drowning in a thin red soup. I've made better at home! My brother in law ordered the chicken parm and his meal was just as bland and boring. The serving of spaghetti he got was tiny, and the chicken breast wasn't even breaded, which may be healthier for you, but it's not chicken parm unless that chicken is deep fried and crispy. The salad we got before the meal was sub standard by any means, low quality ice berg with a few tiny croutons. The creamy pesto sauce that came with it was good, but not so good that it warrants drowning your lettuce in it (which is was). The cheesy garlic bread that we received ten minutes too late was actually pretty decent although a bit greasy for my taste. The sourdough bread was fresh and warm, however, don't expect to get a fresh loaf if the kitchen is out of knives, apparently they won't bring you one unless they have a fresh knife to give you as well. The ice cream we got after the meal was decent enough, I enjoyed the flavor of the spumoni, however, there were ice crystals in it, which leads me to conclude the ice cream tub had been left out and refrozen after a while, ruining the smooth texture it should have. There's no excuse for that. \n\n\n---Summary----\nI don't give out 1 star reviews very often, as I'm usually easier to please, but last night it seemed like it was consistently one thing after another that just piled on top of each other. Eating here made me long for olive garden, which at the very least is quieter and as far as I can tell, has much better food. I can only imagine what the lease is costing them for that location, and I'm sad to say it, but I actually hope they go out of business to save anyone else from the experience of dining there. Maybe they can turn things around, maybe they can't. From the other reviews I've seen so far, it appears as though they're making a habit of pissing off their customers. So there's nothing left to say but good riddance, I hope whoever takes over that space next actually puts some thought into how to run a restaurant.
"""Mill Ave was packed with local stores and had a quirky, fun college town feeling in the 1970s when we moved here. Locals (my family included) went there all the time.

"""I would give this Capital Grille location no stars if possible. I don't mean to be harsh, but I expect A LOT more out of restaurants that charge this much for their food. My mom, brother, boyfriend and I visited Capital Grille, mid-May, for an early birthday dinner for myself. We have never dined at a Capital Grille, but have been to the Palm several times, as well as BLT Steak restaurant group. This was our first experience and last one. We wasted almost $500 on this horrendous dining experience. Number one, we ordered a bottle of wine, it literally took our server, Ken, around 20 minutes to find the bottle of wine in their cellar. We were seated near the cellar where he was searching for the bottle, and watched him. At one point he became flustered and went to check on another table. Finally, he came to table with the wine. My brother and boyfriend started with the French Onion soup, it was decent, but overpriced for what it is. I started with the Lobster Bisque, which had to be sent back because it was cold and had butchered overcooked lobster floating on top. Ken returned with a proper bisque at the correct temperature, also decent but overpriced. My mom had the Spinach salad, very small portion, and the knife cuts were a joke. Mushrooms sliced at different widths, onions, some sliced thin, some sliced thick. Mediocre at best. We didn't even mention the salad until the end of the meal, when things had just become too much. The excuse we received was that this was the \corporate recipe\"""", this is how corporate wants the vegetables sliced, in random different sizes, isn't it about presentation, especially when you pay this much? My brother ordered the Dry Aged Porterhouse, my mom ordered the Kona Crusted Dry Aged Bone In Sirloin, and I ordered the Delmonico. We also ordered their \""""signature\"""" potato gratin, creamed spinach, and the Truffle Fries. Unimpressed in the quality and flavor of meat, I'm not sure if they were even serving Prime that day. Maybe a corporate decision? The gratin was a joke, topped with crushed potato flakes, seriously? Creamed spinach mediocre. The Fries were very good actually, but how can you mess up fries? The most disappointing and shocking moment is when Ken tried to argue with my boyfriend that the steak her ordered, the Dry Aged Steak Au Poivre, which he ordered rare, and came out medium, was rare, until he took to the kitchen and put it under the light. Then comes back to tell us that the salad is on them since we hated it, which my mom only said that it wasn't the best and it wasn't the worst spinach salad she has had. They gave us an on the house coconut cream pie to go. Which I took one bite when I got home and threw it away. Very disappointing when you spend this much money and receive this type of service and quality of food. We might as well set $500 on fire."""""""
I have had similar issues like Jenny R. and Sara B. I am enrolling into CGCC Fall 2011 and I was a MCC student last year so I assumed everything would be updated across both schools, which is how they make it seem. CGCC was charging me out of county/state tuition, so I called and was put on hold for 15 mins, I was told that my account would be updated. Class started a few days later and I was able to log in with no issues. When I logged in on day two, I found out my class was dropped. So I spent another 13 mins on hold trying to resolve this issue, the rep said she watched her coworker update my file with the correct in county/state tuition. I am now showing as enrolled, but it is going to take up to 72 hours before I can access the online course through blackboard. I am so tired of people that cannot do their job. If the second rep could put me on hold for 5 mins to resolve this issue, why did I have to go through this at all?? I am going to take my class and hope December comes fast. Luckily I have completed my undergrad degree and I am just taking a course to help with my job skills. Good luck to the other students that are just starting.
I don't get why everyone loves this restaurant. Maybe the drinks are strong for a reason??? The food is ordinary, although reasonably priced. However, I have been to the restaurant twice and both times had shoddy service. The first time, the restaurant was extremely busy, so I could understand. The last time I was there with 4 colleagues for lunch. Two of us shared entrees. Two of my friends discussed with each other that they would also order a salad and share it, but asked the server not to split the salad, as there is a $5 fee for doing so, and they didn't need two plates. Instead the server did split the salad, so they were charged $10 for splitting both the entree and the salad. Then we found a hair in the hamburger we had split after almost eating all of it. By that time, the server was so slow, that we had run out of time for deserrt, had to return to work, and didn't even have time to discuss the hair in our food. It took forever for the server to come and pick up the payment for our check, so I took it up to the bartender, explaining that we were late getting to work and wanted to take care of it. I was rebuffed, and told that the server had to take it. He did not try to help me locate the server, so I waited some more. I will not return to this restaurant again.
This was a terrible experience.  You can not reach anyone via phone, you have to book online, which I did and also requested a phone call.  I rcvd no call and had an email in my email confirming a time for cleaning.  I requested a call then and got a reply stating someone would call me in 15 mins.  Still no call.  The cleaners arrived & I had someone let them in.  When I returned they were to clean the bathrooms & they were TERRIBLE TERRIBLE!  The sinks were dirty, with tooth paste splatters on sink, the inside of the shower had brown marks from some sort of un rinsed product.  I am so unhappy about this.  I have tried to reach them every day since & have not recieved a call back from a voice mail or email.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY THEY ARE AWEFUL!
Reviews for this place are really misleading.  We went there today, and we were very disappointed.  If you're looking for more authentic Indian food,  this is not the place.  We noticed that the chicken tikka was sweeter than usual, when we asked the chef if it had ketchup or bbq sauce, he mentioned that they did use some ketchup.  \n\nWe ordered 3 other dishes, biryani, lamb chili, and chicken karahi.  The biryani was not fresh - the chicken was sub-par, the lamb chili was OK - a little bland, and the chicken karahi was relatively the better dish of the night.  Again, there was only one other table that was occupied, so maybe they weren't prepared?\n\nWe went there because we were at an event where they catered food from there, and that catered food was much better than what we had at the restaurant.   \n\nNot going back there.
Wow... Another Casualty of our Times\n\nI was just at the cool clothing store Status on New Years eve to buy Hubby a cute couple of things that he might like to wear that evening to our New Years Dinner.  One Rock and Republic pair of jeans and 2 awesome rocker-type button up shirts.  He wore the shirt out to dinner but the pants were a little too tight.\n\nWent there yesterday to see if we could exchange them for him - and like a thief in the night, the Status clothing store was gone.  The only thing that would tell you it was there was the awning.  \n\nWhat irks me more is that I was there only 8 days ago and spoke to the general manager guy about his selection of clothing.  He did not ever mention they were going out of business or moving - and he knew I was buying this for my husband.  I would probably not have bought the jeans for him had i known I couldnt exchange them.\n\nThe rest of City North is just depressing as well.  Ocean Club is still anchoring it.  Food there is good but really more expensive than necessary.  \n\nA real shame about CityNorth.  I thought it was going to be great...
"""The food is good and I have always loved going here for lunch or dinner...until the roaches crawling on the walls, the tables - EEEWW!

If anyone thinks this place is authentic... I wonder what they consider Taco Bell to be? Heaven? I had the bland Chicken Burro which was very disappointing. Then I also had 2 Tamales with Rice and Beans. My friend had 2 Cheese Enchilada plate. When we opened them, we couldn't tell the difference. They were both swimming in the same canned sauce. The only way to tell the difference was finding the maize from a Tamale. As for the rice, I never knew Spanish Rice was supposed to be crunchy and undercooked.... Just over all a let down. AZ should open the border back up and get real food here. If you are a true foodie, don't bother with this place.
"""My friend celebrated her birthday here yesterday evening. We were the first three of about 15 people to show up. The server was really inconsistent and scatterbrained. As soon as we were seated, she asked us if we were ready to order drinks. After telling her we needed some time, she came back two minutes later to ask again. We asked for a HH menu and she came back several minutes later with one. Errrr.. OK, I guess the 3 of us can share... not that big of a deal I suppose. \n\n10 minutes later, she came back and we ordered our drinks and appetizers. While waiting for our orders, more people started to trickle in. By the time she came back to our table, there were about 10+ people passing around 1 happy hour menu. Either that was the only copy in the whole restaurant or she didn't want us to order from it because as soon as someone set it down, she snatched it up and took off w/ it. WTH!? \n\nWhile everyone was laughing about it and asking \did that really just happen?!\"""" our food arrived. My friend & I shared the pork belly cubano and chicken fingers. Both were OK, but they should have just named the pork belly cubano a ham cubano because the piece of pork belly was no larger than 2 fingers. A total disappointment because I was looking forward to the pork belly the most! As for our drinks, she was OK if we flagged her down to take our (alcoholic) drink orders, but she was really scatterbrained when it came to refilling our waters! I asked several times for a refill, but she would walk away after refilling other people's half full glasses and ignore my completely empty glass. She did this to a few other people too that asked for water.\n\nThere were a few other servers that were helping her out w/ our table. When they brought out the orders, they would just drop off the plates wherever they felt like. Sometimes they would drop it off at one end of the table, sometimes in the middle, sometimes at the other end. Never once did they ask who it belonged to. When one dish was brought to my friend, she gave him a puzzled look and he started to walk away. She said \""""I guess I can figure out who this belongs to..\"""" and he came back and said \""""well I guess I can do it if you don't want to...\"""" WTF. Isn't it his JOB to?!? \n\nMy friend said she had a very similar experience last time too. Needless to say, I won't be back. Such a shame since I work right across the street and my co-workers and I eat out almost everyday."""""""
it has been over a year since I visited this hole of a restaurant, but my experience is what counts. The staff was confused and slow to visit our table, the pizza might be the most boring bland pizza I have ever had. The soda didn't taste right and the place was a total mess. To top it off the price was a bit high for something that can't even compete with Peter Piper. I would not go back to Grimaldi's if someone gave me a gift card. Try Prima Pizza sometime ... behind the Taco Bell on Val Vista and Baseline. It is a dive, but the pizza is simply amazing.
This place SUCKS DOG FARTS.  After waiting two hours, I was told that I couldn't get a duplicate title because my copy of a certified financial power of attorney was not the same as a certified copy of an FPOA.  Sounds like an OXYMORON to me.  Well, if a copy is good enough for banks, why not for the MVD?  Well, because it is the gov't!  It doesn't make any sense, except that gov't workers only work to protect their jobs.  If the MVD was a business, they'd be out of business.
"""Stopped by on my way to the Yelp Adopt-A-Family UYE at Metro Brasserie to pick up an oil change gift card, and I was there for half an hour. Worst service ever. If I hadn't waited until the last minute and wasn't just down the street from Metro Brasserie, I would've walked out. But I did, and I was, so I couldn't. So despite all my rage, I was - come on, you know the line - trapped like a rat in a cage. What - too 90s for you?

(goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside) Okay.\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out.\nclerk: What?\ncustomer: They're pulling my car out. I don't think they're not going to rotate the tires.\nclerk: do you still want the tires rotated?\ncustomer: No.\nclerk: (rings him up for oil change, no tire rotation)\n\nMy turn.\nme: \""""I'd like a gift card.\""""\nclerk: \""""How much?\""""\nme: (tell him amount) \nclerk: (stares at register for 5 minutes, every once in a while glancing over at piece of paper taped to wall)\nme: Everything okay?\nclerk: (goes outside, talks to mechanic, comes back inside with mechanic. Together they stare at register for another 5 minutes, then mechanic goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside)\nmechanic: You want a gift card?\nme: Yes.\nmechanic: How much?\nme: (tell him amount)\nmechanic: (goes back outside, talks to another mechanic, comes back inside, stares at register, reads piece of paper, re-reads piece of paper, stares at register...)\nFinally they figure it out - he's got to swipe the gift card.

Noble Beast is a small store with limited products. They've got a ton of dog food but only a small wall of toys and a corner for bedding. If you're looking for pet food, chk out Pet Food Depot, if you're looking for dog toys/clothes/beds, chk out Petsmart. Overall, I don't recommend Noble Beast bcus I found nothing interesting and even if I did, it'd be overpriced. I would give this a half star if I could...and only bcus they have a parking lot.
I read the reviews and still ended up going to this place.. I went in for a manicure only as I thought their prices were too high for anything else. The guy who was doing my nails, did not know how to take gel polish off.  The female worker next to him had to show him how to wrap my nails in aluminum foil, and then show him how to use the tool to get the old polish off.  I should have known at that moment, my gut said run and run fast.  But I stayed to see how it would end.  I chose my color, the guy kept wiping the brush off so that he would use only the most minimal of color on my nails (not what I wanted as I have had this color before and it should look better than clear polish on my nails).  He did not coat down to the cuticle either, he left a huge gap.  When I informed him that my nails needed to stay under the light longer than 30 seconds he argued with me.  I know that they have to be under the light for a minimum of 2 minutes (experience).  And when I told him he will have to put on a 3rd coat, he called to the female (who was helping him before) to come over and talk to me.  She did, and she ended up putting on the additional coats of polish, fixing his mistakes and being frustrated with me. When I paid, the femaile did give me a card and printed on the back that I would get $5.00 off my next visit.  I don't think going back and having a discount is worth the next visit.  I will not be going here again for sure.

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!\n\nThe nurse practitioner on duty was completely incompetent!  She was asking the assistant general procedure questions.  After 15 min. I picked up my baby and walked out.  How can a nurse practitioner not know how to answer general questions?   She actually guessed and then tried to verify with the assistant.  The assistant was very knowledgable and corrected her mistakes.  I left 4 messages and emails for the manager.  After 5 weeks was given a return call to tell me she had passed my messages on to the Doctor in charge.  I never received a call from him and it's now been 2 months.  This facility is horrible.  Go to PCH urgent care instead.  They are great!
This was the WORST Mexican food I have ever had, by far. I would give it a minus star or two if that was possible. Had to pay $2.75 extra for a beef machaca option on my chimichanga, and I expected shredded beef with no fillers. There was huge pieces of piping hot tomato and bell pepper inside, and the meat was flavorless and watery. My wife was asked if the would like sour cream & guacamole with her dish (which was also not meaty and very watery). She said OK- they brought two tiny containers. We also were charged an extra $2.50, and were not informed of that. I am from California, and am almost 50 years old, so I have eaten a lot of authentic Mexican food. This was garbage in it's highest form. The place also didn't smell good, and was dirty. Amazing they have been in business this long. The prices are also very high for any restaurant, especially one with this poor quality.
If you actually look at my reviews you will find that I have reviewed many local places and given them high marks.  This place is the exception.  Walking in and the bartender was coughing into his hands and touching pizza boxes with pizzas already in them and pouring drinks and touching receipts.  Disgusting.  The pizza itself was below average.  Decent crust but very few toppings and the sauce is done in their signature way where they put round dollops of sauce every so often on the crust instead of everywhere.  I'll take everywhere.  There was nothing but crust in several spots, bland as hell, and lame.  We were grossed out by the bartender and couldn't hardly eat anyways but we actually gave it a try.  I will never spend another dime in this location.
"""My boyfriend and I went to this Arriba's location about a week ago.  We are regulars at this location because of my love of their shrimp and scallops enchiladas.  My boyfriend is not a huge fan but he humors me at times.  \n\nWe get seated and he orders enchiladas with red chile.  Our food comes out and his enchiladas have green chile on them.

The waiter says he thought we had said green chile but is very nice and takes it back to the kitchen to have them change it.  \n\nAs I'm starting on my meal, we hear arguing from the kitchen.  We hear someone yell in the kitchen, \I wrote down green chile but that guy out there is saying he said red chile.\""""  After hearing this, we don't really feel comfortable staying at the restaurant.  We call over the manager and explain what happened.

It made us feel unwelcome and as if they thought we were at fault for what had happened.  \n\nI come here mainly for the shrimp and scallops enchiladas, which I absolutely love.  In the past few years, I have noticed the quality of the food decline.  The shrimp/scallop enchiladas used to come out piping hot with lots of cheese and covered in a rich cream sauce.  The last few times I have been to the restaurant, the tortilla has been dry, no sauce, and it looks like they just slapped two pieces of sliced cheese on top of the enchilada.

Finally after 3 different customer service reps-someone was able to locate my account and cancel it.  The next day I got an email confirming that the cancellation had been processed and we stopped getting papers.\n\n2 days later the monthly subscription fee was automatically deducted from my bank account\n\nSee the pattern here?\n\nMy advise- skip the home delivery and take a jog down to QT on Sunday mornings to get those bright colored comics and just check to be sure the paper you pick up as a stack of coupons in it.

So I've eaten at this restaurant before. However, the other night we had a guest in from out of town and an event earlier in the evening. So we booked a reservation at this restaurant, WHICH THEY CONFIRMED.\n\nWhen we walked into the restruant the place wasn't very busy and the greeter informed us that our reservation wasn't going to be honored, but, we were welcome to order a drink at the bar.  Because it was already after 9 at that point we had a difficult time finding a place that could accommodate us on such short notice. \n\nInterestingly we didn't even have the latest reserved seating they were offering, there was one or two even later. \n\nI eat out and entertain a lot for business and personal.  I rarely write totally negative reviews. But, Not honoring a reservation that a restaurant has not only taken but, have CONFIRMED just because the staff is lazy and wants to go home is completely unacceptable and shows a general lack of customer service and care for the client.\n\nI do agree with an earlier reviewer.. If you want seafood go to mccormicks and schmicks or for a more local flare, The Salt Cellar.
We were ever hopeful about sampling great tacos!  Got there around  2:30pm and the line was gigantic to get in.  We kept walking down over the bridge to the Cowboy Ciao area and the line still kept going.  Then we heard people who were leaving the festival saying vendors were already out of tacos!  No sense in waiting 30 minutes in line just to get in and pay $10+ without full opportunity to sample...so we skipped it.  :(\nHopefully organizers will plan more shade, better flow and longer lasting food supplies from the vendors next year!

Not cool... and Jessica is never going back.\n\nSo I went home that night and searched for my receipt.  Nope...

Sadly, I would NEVER go back to this shop or recommend anyone.  I was ready to go 500 miles to witness my first grandchild be born and knew I needed a new tire.  So, I ran over to this shop, and instead of getting one or maybe even two tires I was told I needed ALL FOUR replaced!  I was in shock, as my son is a certified mechanic, and was at work, so I didn't have time to have him verify, but he would have warned his mother of this, if needed.  I agreed to this, feeling like I had no choice, and asked them to put one of the tires, which still had plenty of tread as my spare.  After all was said and done, I had paid a ridiculous amount, extra fees added to my quote, felt completely preyed upon as a woman there alone, and my spare had NOT been replaced as I asked.  I had been completely ripped off.  When I got home, my son was furious, as he said there is NO way all four of those tires needed to be replaced.  As I was on my way to a celebration of my grandchild, I did not have the energy or time to spend going back to fight this negative situation - rather, I will make sure and NOT EVER go there again, nor refer anyone!  I have since found and used Joes' Tires in Chandler, and they have been honest, reasonable and awesome to deal with EVERY time!! Sad, that a single mother, can't trust a nationally known tire shop.
If your buying a Mastercool evap from Home Depot do not have Delta Mechanical install it!   Less then a week after having Delta out a second time after installation and the Mastercool was supposably fine, it started making quite a bit of noise. I hired a heating & cooling company to see why the Mastercool was making so much noise. They found that it was not level, one side was an inch higher, the belt was too tight, the water level was too high causing a lot of water drainage out the pvc pipe.  Besides all of that they left the cookie tray laying up on the roof and didn't supply a customer care booklet nor the warranty card with the cooler.  I must say though they do excell at blowing smoke up your ass!
Oil, Oil, Oil ... too much oil on the food ... unless I went on a bad day, these guys are clueless as to how to cook good/great barbeque.

She tried to squeeze it, so that there wouldn't be so much and a bunch of oil came rushing out ....  lucky, we had the sauce on the side or it would have destroyed the interior of my car  ... you don't cook barbeque so it's like a greasepit ... people in arizona have no clue as to what good southern BBQ is all about ... I also ordered the sweet fries and they came rolled in a ball and again dripping with oil ... It's a glorified grease pit and you better have a bathroom nearby, because my wife had me driving home 80 miles an hour so she could take care of business ... Joe's BBQ in Mesa is much better and the food is dryer (still not as good as back east, but pretty darn good overall) ... Stacy is trying to serve up a sponge ... As bad as the BBQ in Arizona usually is, this takes it to a new low ...  I wouldn't eat there for free ... Go yourself and notice that it is dripping grease from the moment they hand it to you .... Realize that once you eat that stuff you have no idea what kind of pain you can feel afterwords ....   Note: the service was better than expected ... very polite-nice girls ... Grade D- ... these are all my opinions and no I don't work for any of the competitors (here in arizona) aren't that great either-trust me ...
"""We've eaten at this Chipotle several times and, although it is not one of my favorite places to eat, I recognize that the supposed quality of the food may be better than other fast food restaurants.  That being said today's experience was not a good one!  We arrived just before noon and there were few people there.  The employees were apparently  filling an order that seemed to be causing them some trouble and our food, once started, sat on the prep line for longer that it should have before they finished it.  I took two bites of my taco and the meat was refrigerator cold, not lukewarm from sitting on the counter too long.  I informed the manager and suggested that perhaps their warming trays were not operating properly and she checked and said everything was at targeted temperature.  I had her touch the meat in my taco to demonstrate that the meat was cold.  She agreed with me and said she would make me another.  15 minutes later, since my husband had finished his meal, I approached her and asked that my money be refunded.  She said she had totally forgotten about my taco and she couldn't refund my money because the cash register had frozen and she was trying to get someone on the phone.  Only after I stood there a moment did she offer a \card\"""" for the next time we visit.  I told her there wouldn't be a next time.  I can forgive one oversight, even two on a restaurant visit, but these folks totally \""""dropped the ball\"""" on ours."""""""
"""I will be moving to Phoenix in the Winter and I thought I'd scout out some LFS while I was visiting, which led me to Reef Culture. At first I was positive seeing some nice looking displays and LED use, however this soon changed.\n\n On closer inspection, lots of the tanks were infested with aiptasia and bubble algae, and prices of coral were hugely inflated compared to other prices in the area and back home. The people were very unprofessional and unfriendly and first ignored me entirely despite trying to flag someone down. When I did manage to get their attention, I was belittled and treated like a child who knew nothing about the hobby (I have had marine tanks for over a decade ranging from large 55 gallon+ to tiny DIY LED picos). \n\nAfter this rude and demeaning experience, I continued to peruse the last few tanks and came across an angler fish. I watched him and he followed me as I walked down the isle as far as his tank would go and I backtracked a couple steps, amused that he was slowly walking along the tank with me. There was a loud crack as the man behind the counter slammed the phone down, snapped his fingers at me, and told me to \stop harassing the fish.\"""" Keep in mind, I was not tapping on glass or prodding anything as I am quite short and I could barely reach to the high up tank where the angler fish was, much less reach to \""""harass\"""" any fish. After this rude treatment I promptly left. This kind of unprofessional treatment of the customers is shocking and unacceptable, not to mention the bubble algae infested tanks (one spore of that on the water that you get your coral in and your tank is infected too). \n\nI won't be doing business here when I move."""""""
Came here with a large group one night when a military friend was back in town. We came VIP. Service was horrible. We ordered rinks and 4 bottles and we had to go to the bar and ask for them.  We went walking around only to not be let in another VIP spot because the idiot who let us in forget to give us bracelet things. \n\nI am pretty sure the guys with me were the only straight ones in the bar that night. I saw WAY too many dudes kissing each other. \n\nWe complained about our horrible treatment and we got offered a VIP pass for next time. What a JOKE! I will never come back here an hope no one else would ever go there either!
I don't generally like fast food because it's just gross but I was starving and we had a 3 hour layover.  \n\nMy sub was like eating a brick of salt.  I could only eat half of it and that was really pushing it. \n\nI asked the cashier for a napkin. She pointed to the empty containers and told me they were over there.  After looking and telling her they were empty she sent someone out to refill them.  I waited 10 minutes for a napkin.
First of all, I incorrectly thought I was going to the other high rated Hawaiian place because I didn't pay attention to the name or address.  I just knew this place replaced Julio too's (dating myself) and checked it out.  \n\nPretty much everything about my meal was poor.  All of the sides are either really bad impersonations of Korean sides, or corn straight out of the Del Monte can.  The seaweed used white vinegar, the cabbage was bland, and the clear noodle things were just not tasty.  \n\nI got a combo plate with BBQ chicken and the short ribs.  The short ribs were chewy with very tough fat on them.  They were not that good.  The BBQ chicken was not that good either and resembled slimy dark meat chicken that you find in a Panda Express rice bowl.  I guess the white rice was... white... and made of rice.  At least they didn't screw that part up.\n\nfor $10 I expect a much better meal.  I ate about half of it and threw the rest away.  I will never go back, and if you are someone that wants a lot of these flavors, go check out Cho Dang in Chandler.  It seems a lot of Paradise's (horribly ironic name) food is highly influenced by Korean food but poorly done.  You can get a better meal at a sit down place for less money at Cho Dang.  \n\n If you want food that rivals Samurai Sam's, Kyoto Bowl, or Panda Express than this is your place.  If you want decent food I suggest looking elsewhere.  I will be checking out the other Hawaiian joint around the corner to see if it is any better.  I am clueless on how this place averages 4 stars.  They deserve 1 star, but I was going to be nice and go with 2.  However, I just remembered that they do not have a public restroom which always chaps my ass.
"""Oh Good Lord Baby Jesus.  How I loath clubs like these ... nothing againts this place ... just the genre in general.\n\nI was there REALLY early but there were so few \ladies\"""" and the guys for the most part looked like middle aged tools desperate for a date.\n\nThen again, perhaps a large part of it may have had something to do with the party in celebration of a calendar of Big Ten college girls in swimsuits (how novel!).\n\nThis is EXACTLY why Scottsdale is ... well ... Scottsdale."""""""
The food was okay but the service was horrible.  The table was not cleaned when we were seated. A girl came to clean the table with a smelly dirty rag and brushed all the crumbs on our laps. I asked if she would please get a clean cloth. When she came back she argued with me...told me the last one was clean. If a cloth smells enough for me to notice then it's full of bacteria and not at all clean. No wifi either. Why? The waitress said it's because people stay too long. I will not be visiting any Applebee's again.
Decided to check this place out because they had a good deal on GrouponNow.\n\nVery unprofessional and unorganized. Look, just because you are an aesthetician doesn't mean you can run a business. This particular establishment is a prime example.\n\nI bought the GrouponNow which is only valid for a time specified for one day. In this case I had until 6pm to redeem. I tried calling all morning to schedule an appt. No answer.\n\nSo I just went down there. Walked in, rang the bell, heard some ladies chatting in the back. After waiting for 15 mins, I finally walked into the back and said HELLO?! Finally the owner came out and said they were closed. Closed? I informed her that she had a GrouponNow running that day. She apologized and offered me a free treatment for my inconvenience. I appreciated that and left.\n\nWhen I called back to schedule they said they were booked up for the next month! Today, I saw another GrouponNow for them and decided to call and see of they had any openings. This time, at least someone answered the phone! She told me they were booked up the next month. What?\n\nI'm just confused as to why this business keeps running GrouponNow specials that people cannot redeem?\n\nA med spa needs to be staffed and organized before they open their doors. This business is an unprofessional disaster. I hope people check Yelp before buying Groupons to so-called med spas.
Worst, slow service ever....especially with almost no one in the place. Food was average at best and thats being kind. Skip it if you are looking to eat or get a drink.\n\nJust an update: I (as well as a friend who wrote a review of the day) were contacted (I didn't see my message until today oops) and offered refunds and gift certificates. Now this seems all well and fine-I do appreciate them trying to make the most of the situation-but my friend is still waiting for a refund and/or certificate. So we shall see. If I could take away my star for more non-service then I would.
God only knows how a company can hire such incompetent and disorganized employees.   Does Nationwide provide any training in customer service at all????   \n\nI just don't get it.  With so many thousands of bright people looking for work, how does a national company end up with such terrible employees?\n\nI mean, how difficult is it to do an accurate eye exam and send it to the lab to get processed?   (Based on my experience here, it must be about as difficult as flying to Jupiter, as they can't seem to get ANYTHING right.)\n\nI've had five experiences with this Nationwide branch (eye exam, 2 types of glasses), and each one has resulted in major errors resulting in delays in receiving glasses.   The employees don't listen, don't write things down, don't follow up, and worst of all they act like they are doing you a favor by even being there.
"""VEGANS, BEWARE! \n\nWhen I first started going here I asked specific questions about the \veggie\"""" meat, Was it Vegan? Did it contain any dairy or egg? etc. \nI was assured that it was absolutely vegan and a 100% soy product. \n\nI recently heard that their \""""veggie\"""" meat contained egg whites. \nI called up and asked them to please look at the ingredient list to verify this and sure it enough it contained Egg Whites!! \n\nI am so upset that that the owner/manager of this shop was so ignorant  that he could profess the vegan wonders of this \""""veggie\"""" meat to me knowing that it was not. \n\nI'm appalled by the false pretense and all the times I ate here unknowingly putting things in my body which are not OK with me. \nWhat if I had been deathly allergic to eggs?"""""""
bland.  dry.  underwhelming burger.  sure they have many options but so does fuddruckers and fuddruckers is crap as well.  chicago hamburger co is where it's at.  \n\nspent 20 for girlfriend and i ate original hamburger works and won't be doing that again anytime soon.  and that burger was not 1/2 pound.  the only good thing was that they had red cream soda.  by far the most disappointing place i;ve been that i heard about via this website.\n\nthanks for misleading yelpers.  this place doesnt believe in seasoning.\n\nbtw.  chili fries tastes like carl's jr's.  100% crap.
"""Fail.\n\nThey serve food till midnight, so we rolled through here at 11 PM on a First Friday. \n\nThe waiter kept forgetting things we asked for... water, menus, etc. \n\nFrench fries - oops chips - tasted like they had been sitting out for a while. Cool and mushy... not my idea of a good chip.\n\nMy clam chowder was kind of thin though it tasted OK. It was lacking potatoes. Kinda weird. \n\nOrdered a Strongbow cider on tap... and it's flat. Since the server was nowhere to be found, I went up to the bar. Bartender: \Oh the cider is usually a little flat! Don't worry about it!\"""" (WHAAA???) Me: \""""No - it's really flat. I think my water is fizzier.\"""" Turns out it was the bottom of the tap and there's none left, and they aren't opening another till the next day. So no drinkey drinkey for Adam.

"""This place actually gets 0 stars. Front desk was unfriendly when I made my appt. Then the day I had a scheduled appt. I called for their location( because it was my first time there) and I was on hold for 10 min. The first time I called I waited 5 min. I hung up and called back. Before she put me on hold again I told the receptionist I was in the complex and just needed to know what direction to go. Her response back was I have another call you need to hold. I drove around for 5 min. and found the place. When I pulled up she came back on the phone. I told her I found it and she said oh ok. Not sorry you were on hold for so long or thank you for waiting. I then go in, start filling out my paperwork and a woman walks up to the desk to tell the other girl who she was talking too and adds \yeah and this lady kept calling and I kept telling her to hold\""""! I reply yes that was me! She looks at me and walks away. Are you serious you are talking about a patient in the patient waiting area. Who trained you on customer service. Obviously know one. I walked out. I refuse to give business to a co. that is so rude. Mind you I just moved here amd my fiance and I were going to be new patients. I will tell everyone I know  not to go there. While I was driving around for 10 min. on hold I found another dentist. Dr. Johnathen Koerperick who we have both gone to and his staff is wonderful the moment you walk in or call.  I guess it was a blessing in disguise."""""""
I've thought about this before writing this because of being a small business owners and understanding that maybe the owners and staff just had a bad day.  I didn't want to write this because everyone is entitled to their own opinion of services and food and didn't want to damage another business reputation with just my opinion. So here it goes.\nMy son and I go here to eat all the time because it's convenient instead of having to drive all the way out to Phoenix or Mesa for really good Pho.  It's good, not great by any means but could be great if you just don't know anything about Pho.  However, the service here is the worst I've ever experienced.  I know that Pho places really aren't known for service but this place is just rude.  Try Unphogettable in Mesa so you can see what good food and service is about and you will know what I mean about rude here.\nI've just always put up with it because it's just typical of Pho restaurants.  So, headed back to work, my friend asked me to pick up an order to go for her.  After waiting for about 20 minutes after we were done eating for the to go order even though we placed the order when we ordered our other food too, the order came back wrong.  I told the pregnant owner what our correct order was.  She placed the order by the registered and left us there hanging.  After another 20 minutes, I asked for the order again.  She said they are too busy and have decided not to correct the order.  I asked her why she didn't tell me and would just make me sit there and wait.  No answer other than that she is too busy to deal with it.  So, I pay and put under the tip line none because poor service.  Actually wrote that in so that they won't write in their tips, which they have done once before on me. \nI reconciled my statement over the weekend and pull out my receipt.  Apparently, I have now also been charged the to go order even though I didn't take it.  Called and she answered and argues with me that I took the order.  This is ridiculous.  We are not some scam artist or willing to lie over some $9 order.  Tried to explain to her that we did not but she just hung up the phone on me.  Wow!!  Talk about hormonal...
I don't like the pizza hear and if you go for lunch there are no specials by the slice.  The ranch tastes bottled and tastes gross.  The ingredients are not fresh but rather canned (also gross).  The chicken wings were not that great either.  The atmosphere was nice for a casual place with a couple of flat screen TV's on the wall.  I will not be going back to this place, so hopefully they get better soon since Barro's pizza is going in the area soon.
How do I give NO stars? Ok, I get that it is Walmart and to some degree you have to just buck up and deal because it is going to be dirty, everyone who works there is going to by unhappy, etc. However, this Walmart hit a new Walmart low for me this week when I ordered a camera and storage card online to pick it up on this store. \n\nThe card was ready immediately, but the camera would not be ready for pickup for one week. No problem, except I received an e-mail that if I did not pickup the card with 48 hours the card would be put back on the shelf and I would be credited. So I called the store and politely explained that I would like to make only ONE trip to Walmart and asked if they could hold the card a few more days. Before I could finish, I was interrupted by a teenage boy manager and was told there was NO WAY they could hold it and that was policy, no exceptions. When I pressed him he told me I could not speak to the store manager and instead I should call walmart.com. Which I did, and they hung up on me. Awesome.\n\nBottom line: they were unhelpful and because I need the camera for work I kept the order. But that will be the last time I ever deal with Walmart.
If I could award them 0 stars, I would. Simply put, they are horrible! \n\nI ordered flowers through FTD & they were handled by this florist. Not only did they not fulfill the order as I placed it (for a 50th birthday gift for a lifelong friend), when I called them, they were condescending, rude & bashed the FTD company itself! That is their bread & butter as far as I am concerned, and, any disparaging comments toward FTD should have been directed toward FTD, not me. I was the consumer. I spent about $75.00 for these flowers, and, they sent a completely different arrangement than I ordered. When calling to ask about it, they were so rude!\n\nYou've got many choices for florists....keep your hard earned cash for another one because these people do not appreciate your business & they do NOT fill orders as you place them. They do whatever they want to do! They used cheap lilies....this is not a funeral arrangement, it's a celebration arrangement!!
"""ZERO stars!\nI traveled from STL to SFO a few weeks ago (with a layover in PHX). I have a couple complaints;\nOne, I was checking 2 pieces of luggage in STL. One ended up being 14lbs. over weight (it was a cooler with food I bring home each year from my dad). I was charged an additional $90 on top of the $35 initially for the cooler to ship (including the $25 for my first bag- so $150 total)! This is an OUTRAGEOUS additional charge! I thought overweight bags were charged an additional $25 like other airlines I've had to pay at but $120 to ship one bag is just insane (and a set price for overweight bags is NOT listed on your website)! On top of that I paid $250 for a pet ticket so my baggage fees were $400 total... $100 more than my round trip ticket to fly. I couldn't believe that!\nOn another note, the woman agent helping me at STL was the most rude customer service agent I've ever dealt with anywhere! She was rude to me about the overweight baggage and then claimed my dog was too tall to fit in her carrier so she claimed she wouldn't allow her to fly. She raised he voice at me and called me \a very inhumane person\"""" for making a dog ride like that for a whole flight; seriously making me cry. I fly all over the country to do shows with my dog and this has never been a problem, including on the first leg of my trip when I bought the round trip dog ticket in SFO. This woman name-calling was totally inappropriate... people in line beside me were astonished. Since I had my round trip dog ticket purchased already, and she was sick of fighting with me over it, she let me go but told me the gate person probably wouldn't let me on the flight (and of course the gate person did).\nBetween the dog crate episode and the bags, I have never been treated so poorly and charged with such ridiculously high adage fees. I'm very disappointed to not be able to fly US Air anymore since I never had problems with them in the past. It was a horrible way to end a very nice holiday vacation.\nI have passed the word on to as many people and websites as possible not to fly this airline!"""""""
The contrarian review... from an espresso purists perspective.\n\nIn my desperate search to find espresso near my hotel (which I think is old downtown, but I get confused easily) I put this place on my list.\n\nTo their credit, when I ordered a ristretto con panna, the barista thought she knew what I meant. I clarified, which is fine, and she went about making it. However, it wasn't drinkable. I got it to stay so I could enjoy it if it was decent, so I had to drink some while the barista watched, but I couldn't get it all down, even with 3 sugars (did that make sense to anyone?). I don't think it's even good enough to make a decent latte, either, so I won't be back.\n\nOn the other paw, they were playing some Flyleaf, so the music is good.

"""Thanks God for plans with no contracts! This will be one thing I miss about TMobile BUT, with no regrets, I AM NOW A VERIZON WIRELESS CUSTOMER AGAIN! WOO HOO! 7 years later, that is... \n\nAlright, so the MAJOR issue I had with TMobile is either their phones or network suck! I don't care at this point to find out which one it was as I am happily back with Verizon. I got mislead a million times by customer service because they wanted me to stay with a windows based operating phone for some reason. Either way, something was not right and they couldn't resolve my issue over a 2 year span worth of my patience! That's ridiculous in itself! \n\nSo If you have a few minutes, I'll tell you all a little story. Go ahead, grab a snack and an ice cold refreshment and take a seat. I'll wait for you to get back... \n\n2 years ago I had a phone that was giving me problems. I had had that phone for about a year. After a couple of replacement phones, they recommended I upgrade; especially for what I mainly needed my phone for (I do Real Estate, need web access, etc.) and I needed to catch up with the times anyhow so I was cool with that. I ended up getting the most expensive phone they had at the time (HTC Touch Pro 2). Cool phone when it worked but I ended up going thru 5 master resets and 8 (YES, I SAID EIGHT!) replacement phones in one year! And the crappy part is, they had just come out with the HTC HD2 a month after I bought that phone and it was a million times better AND about $100 cheaper!!! Were they gonna tell me this?! NO! Would they let me swap phones because I was an awesome, very patient and one of their coolest customers? HELL NO!! I was stuck with a crappy phone and all the problems it had for over a year before I had to threaten to leave! FINALLY, they upgraded me to the HD2. And guess what??? Yep, again, you guessed it... After a month of trying it out, it started up again. The problems were continuing and they wanted to do the replacement thing. All the customer service people were astonished by the encyclopedia size notes that were noted on my account for the past 2+ years yet they can never manage to satisfy my cellular needs :( The Loyalty Dept (aka: Retention Dept) was the worst! Supposedly they have magical powers and can make things all better so that everyone's happy again! Nope, they would insult me with crappy offers that would make the average person wanna strangle their necks thru the phone! Not to mention that for the last few months I was with them, it would take (and this is no exaggeration) a minimal of 45 minutes on hold before I could get to someone! DID THEY KNOW I WAS CALLING AGAIN?!?!?! 45 effin minutes!!! MINIMUM!!! \n\nThe best solution they had was for me to upgrade AGAIN to a Android operating system (thanks for the late recommendation, 2 years later!) phone with a 2 year contract when I was on a month to month plan. With all the issues I was having and problems I went thru and inconveniences, etc, I voted against that thought. If I was to sign another contract, it was not going to be thru them! I was not going to be \TRAPPED\"""" for 2 years after what I wen thru. 7 years of my loyalty down the drain because this is how like to show loyal customers they are appreciative. \n\nI love my Droid X! It does everything I ever wanted and more! Thanks Verizon! \n\nThe End \n\n***Da Bafroom: They ain't nun heya"""""""
Came here last month with my boyfriend for some sandwiches.  Such...a...disappointment.  As someone who frequents Mill Ave and all of its shops/restaurants/bars often, I often walk past In Season Deli and it's rarely even open.  I thought we had lucked out when we actually saw two people in there so we strolled in.\n\nWe asked for two turkey sandwiches with the works and he also asked for a side of pasta salad.  Now there was only one older woman making the sandwiches, but it literally took about 20 minutes to get our food.  There was literally a fly swirling around their display case of their pastas, puddings, etc.  The lights in the case were blinking the whole time, made it very unappealing.  \n\nNot sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing, but they didn't even have any of their tables or chairs pulled out for customers, (maybe there weren't any yet that day?) so one of the employees pulled them all out for us and turned the misters on which was enjoyable.\n\nThe sandwiches were nothing special.  Something you would expect to see in a 2nd grader's brown bag lunch.  Regular wheat bread, oscar meyer brand turkey, one piece of lettuce, soggy tomato, mayo, and mustard.  His pasta salad had a film on it from being old, he didn't touch it.  Their sign actually fell off the wall as we tossed our food, it was priceless.\n\nReally wouldn't be surprised if this place closes down.
"""Vile megastripmall of the future.

Gross! I got a combo platter of chicken curry. On the menu it had a red pepper next to it, meaning to signify that it was spicy, but the curry was extremely bland, and it looked like greasy water. I assume that it is because they have such a thin curry that the dish was served in a cup-shaped fried egg roll wrapper. Not only was the sauce a disappointment, but the chicken was extremely fatty. \n\nThe fact that it was a combo platter meant that I also received side dishes... First of all, their fried rice has no egg or veggies in it, so it's just soy sauce-soaked salty rice. The egg roll was okay, although it was the heaviest egg roll I've ever encountered, since it was primarily fried wrapper around meager contents. There was also a side of horribly MSG-laden lo-mein. Finally there were two buffalo wings which I never got to because by that point I was not really wanting to eat any more of their food offerings.\n\nFirst bad meal out I've had in a long time (food-wise, anyway... at least the staff was pleasant). Maybe they have other foods that they are better at making? I don't know, and won't be back to find out!
"""Totally agree with the other reviewers about Einstein's being overpriced. A small coffee alone costs $1.91 after tax and adding cream cheese to a bagel costs more than the bagel itself. Sure, the bagels are pretty good, but this is Mesa, not New York City.\n\nMy real beef with this place, though, is the customer service. Although there are always plenty of people behind the counter, I have waited numerous times in a line that reaches the door. On my visit this morning, I saw a customer walk in, see the line, and turn right back around. Also on my visit today, I tried using a coupon for a \free bagel thin with light shmear.\"""" The picture in-store advertised the bagel thin with pink cream cheese and my kids were excited to get their bagel with strawberry cream cheese (which is also listed as one of their reduced-fat options, which means \""""light,\"""" right?) When I ordered this, however, I was told that this was not possible because corporate is only allowing them to use ONE kind of light shmear for this promotion. Even the general manager refused to make a substitution, while watching my 3-year-old cry with disappointment (I know, it's a little thing, but come on, he's 3.) So congratulations, Einstein's at Gilbert & Baseline. You've just made a customer never want to return over your refusal to substitute 2 tablespoons of cream cheese.

This is hands down the worst Pizza I have ever had. I had to go to Nello's after hearing my boss rave about it. I went on a Saturday night; the place was about 20% full. I ordered a sausage, onion and greenpepper thin crust. My first clue that this experience was taking a turn for the worse was when the pizza arrived with the toppings on top of the cheese. Maybe that's why there was no taste. Not even the seasoned pepper's flakes could bring this pie to life. The sausage was nasty. In summary, Nello's was brutal.
"""Possibly the worst pizza and wings I have ever had! Ok, listen, I know Iarrived about 5 min before they closed their kitchen but I called about 15 min earlier and phoned my order for pickup. This still doesn't excuse them for selling crap. The pizza was super thin with virtually no sauce or crust. I know NY pizza is kinda supposed to be thin but \common man\""""! Even the ingredients were terrible. Low quality bread cheese n pepperoni. I really honestly feel that a Tony's frozen pizza from the super market would have been better. The wings were overcooked, sauceless and very very salty. The only reason I did not take this stuff back is because they were about 4 miles away and my brother n I were very hungry. I come from Los Angeles and I have only been in AZ for a little over 1 month but so far my experience with pizza hasn't been great. This place should be ashamed to serve the crap they do. I never even write reviews good or bad but they got me to actually write one. I would have rated negative stars if I could... SMFH!! I will neva, eva, evaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva.... come here again! Go to Oregano's instead. It's like night and day even though you have to wait forever, it's well worth it."""""""
"""OVERPRICED & DECEITFUL & RUDE!\n\nI should have read the reviews before I came here! I took a bridesmaid dress in to have the top taken in like 1/4 inch, not much. I asked her, how much will this cost? She assured me it would not be \much\"""". It was $60 and she hardly did a thing, can't even steam it there. I was irate but calmly asked her if she could charge less and she screamed NO! She said it's because the dress cost more. Yeah...like that matters A guy was there dropping off pants that needed taken OUT which is a lot more work, she charge him $18.50 for each pair. I don't know if that is good for pants a lot but her pricing scale seems way off!\n\nPreviously I've been to 5th Avenue Alterations and they charge me $50 for a floor length brdiesmaid dress that they took in the whole thing AND steamed it. They're also polite and will work with you on pricing and communicate with you beforehand. Definitely worth the few extra minutes of a drive!!"""""""
After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\n\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\n\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\n\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\n\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \n\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.
In an effort to start on a positive note, I will say that this place has a nice atmosphere. It's a very open space and I could see myself enjoying a beer on the patio during happy hour...if only the happy hour prices were desirable enough to prompt a return visit.\n\nThis is not a place you want to visit with intent to enjoy Vietnamese food as it is overpriced and for lack of better words...gross. The roll we ordered for an appetizer was okay, but the serving size was shameful considering the price, and the peanut sauce I requested on the side was very watery. Pho was the man dish, and it wasn't any better. In fact, it was worse. And with fake meat and funky flavor, it was left unfinished.\n\nIt makes me sad to think that someone may have their first Vietnamese dining experience here and potentially never eat it again as a result. I hope the owners consider sprucing up their recipes, or if nothing else dropping the 2nd half of their name, so that patrons visiting with the intent to dine on Vietnamese Cuisine won't be left disappointed.
"""My thought: \someone rescue me from the rude, crazy behemoth lady!!!\""""\n\nI guess I should start from the beginning. I am in a time crunch and starving, and remembered that Wendy's is usually pretty solid when it comes to burgers. I decide to go to the drive thru.\n\nLady: \""""HEEEELOOOO!!!\""""\nMe: :\""""umm..hi, I need just a minute\""""\nLady: (heavy breathing and a grunt) \""""fine\""""\n\nI'm pondering and decide on the Swiss Jr Bacon and 5pc Chicken nuggets and order.\n\nMe: \""""Ma'am?\""""\nLady: \""""YES\""""\nMe: \""""I would like the chicken nuggets and the Jr bacon swiss\""""\nLady: \""""Next window\""""\n\nWow...I wonder what this broad looks like. My guess was something mean and ape-looking. I prepare to have the food thrown in my lap and arrive at the window. The lady just sticks her hand out of the window. I guess she want my debit card. I hand it to her. Nothing. She says nothing! Hands me the food. I ask if she had included Ranch (for my chicken nuggets). \""""No, I don't think so\"""". Well CAN I EFFING HAVE SOME RANCH...Puhlease!!!?!\n\nAfter all that, I wanted to take my chicken nuggets and burger and throw them in her face. It may have made her look better. Grrr..."""""""
Why bother? My only question I have for the owners of this place. \n  Out of pale ale, out of IPA, doesn't offer growlers to take out their beer, employees could care less if you were in there (and we were the only ones in there). Cute Marketing approach with all the Dog names, Dog bone shaped platters to hold the tester beers and TV with rotating dog photos....but you forgot to MAKE the BEER for people to buy and drink!!\nWho runs out of Pale Ale and IPA?  \nSorry but I think we will soon be calling this place Dead Dog Brewery.
"""God damn this place, another hype restaurant. Let me tell you, I showed up 12 minutes after the opening of business hours, I walk in & the F'n staff isn't saying anything to me, just walking back & forth. Finally I stare down some lady, she looks at me & says \were at capacity, you need to come back in 3.5 - 4 hours if you want to eat\"""" You know what, I don't care how F'n great this place is supposed to be, because that is not good practice, it's ridiculous & any moron who waits that long for food is F'd up in the head!!!! You want good Italian food in Phx.? You aint gonna find it here, because once you drive west of the Mississippi you lose the ethnic flavor & rich history of real Italian food, where you can achieve four star worthy dining at many local neighborhood eateries on a poor man's budget without the hype..."""""""
I'm done with this place.  We went here last year and 2 days later I got a call from my CC company that my number was compromised and I was able to narrow it down to this place.  We tried to go here last Friday but gave up after having to listen to the manager and bartender argue with a customer about his takout order.  I can't stand restaurants that argue with customers.  There are far too many burger spots popping up around town to deal with these guys.
I went here to buy some pan de sal and empanadas and they were horrible! The pan de sol tasted like it was made dayyyyyyys ago, not fresh at all. The empanadas looked like like they were going to taste good, but the crust was so hard! I had to break it off to get to a decent part I could actually chew, but after a few bites I spit it out. Yes, it was that bad. I will never go back here again.
"""Worst. Mexican. Place. Ever. \n\nThis was the most over-priced, crappy food I have ever eaten in the Phoenix area. \n\nWhen you walk in it looks legit and even smells pretty good due to the wood they use to smoke some of their chicken. Once I opened the menu, I could not believe it. I think the cheapest dinner item was over $16. I tried the carnitas, a Mexican staple and something I usually enjoy. Not this time. In one word BLAND. No seasoning whatsoever. No salt. No pepper. No lime. Nothing at all to make this meat taste decent. It was tender, I will give them that, but it was more like jello than pork. The texture was pretty gross. We also had to pay extra to get tortillas with the carnitas. Who the hell does not serve tortillas WITH their carnitas? Seriously....\n\nThe black beans were okay, the only part of the meal I could actually stomach. The rice was crunchy and bland. The salsa was bland and watery. Also, no refills on the salsa... Cheap bastards charge me over $16 for BLAND CRAP and cannot even fill up my salsa for free?\n\nThe service was bad, slow and aloof. \n\nI would rather eat at one of the \bertos\"""" instead of this crap hole. Honestly, save yourself the money and find another Mexican joint. I am in shock that this place has customers.  Not even deserving of one star. That bad."""""""
"""My wife and I flew from upstate NY to San Juan PR for our cruise.  \n\nOur flight from Albany NY left at 5:15am.  We are constantly bombarded with:  \Get to the airport 90 minutes before departure!\"""".  We got there at exactly at 3:45am and....just a big line of people waiting.  Evidently US air doesn't open until 4am.  There were 3 US Air flights that morning, all before 5:30!  How about organization of US airways?  How about opening ON TIME!??!\n\nThen we got to Philadelphia.  Checked the gate number on the big board.  Gate A21. Had to take a bus to a terminal A.  Checked the gate number on the big board again.  Gate A21.  As we are walking to our gate (15 minute walk), I hear something about a San Juan, US air gate change.  Check the gate number on the big board again.  Find out it's B33.  Which is a 20 minute walk in the other direction!\n\nGet to B33 and it's a zoo.  Evidently other people magically got the memo that it's B33, not A21.  I'm in shape but I nearly ran for 30 minutes with heavy carryons and just made the initial boarding call.  Had I walked, i would've missed the flight.  How about US Airways giving connecting passengers some notice?!??!  I nearly missed this flight!\n\nThen I hear some announcement about an aircraft change and the flight being overbooked and offering a $300 credit for your next flight with US airways.  And then moans and groans.  Then I can't hear the rest of the announcement.   Followed by passengers getting confused and angry (by their reactions).  \n\nThen it's a game of \""""Broken Telephone\"""" as the message spreads:  The new aircraft is smaller.  It was supposed to be 8 seats per row, now the new aircraft is only 6.  So whoever has \""""G\"""" and \""""H\"""" seats are BUMPED.  Frantically get our boarding passes out and it's \""""A\"""" and \""""B\"""".  If I had a G or H seat, I don't make my flight, I don't make my cruise.  The people next to us are furious.  They have G and H seats.  Felt really bad for them.  \n\nAbsolute chaos at gate B33 in PHL ensues!!!  (I should've taken video!).  People yelling and SCREAMING at US airways staff.  About 60 people just had their vacations ruined.\n\nPositives were that they didn't call out zones:  just as long as you didn't have a G or H seat, you were golden.  And they didn't offer the credit card with 40,000 on the flight either.  I guess the pilots knew that everyone was a bit miffed because we were 30 minutes late coming out of the gate and magically got there in time.\n\nNegatives about US airways (other than above):  No on-flight entertainment.  They had TV's because that's how they did the safety instructions.  But no TV, no movies.  I knew they had them because it started for a couple of seconds (30 Rock) but THEY SHUT THEM OFF!  No Satellite radio either!!!  THEY SHUT THEM OFF AFTER PULLING OUT OF THE GATE and NEVER TURNED THEM ON DURING FLIGHT!  We know that you want to charge us, but come on!\n\nBTW, we got to San Juan and there were about 60 pissed off passengers there because the same thing was going on the return flight back to Philly.  \n\nEPIC FAIL"""""""
"""Salty Senorita sucks.\n\nI suspect this is true for all locations, but this one in particular really blew. I used to work across Inverness from this joint and my coworkers and I occasionally went here for super-mega-overpriced happy hour. Seriously, 6pm drink prices were so gnarly that I am loathe to imagine reg libation costs.\n\nI think the worst part of this dive - beyond the so-so not-really-Mexican food and the awkward atmosphere - is the unreasonably uncomfortable service. I ordered a double vodka on the rocks and the squeamish server-ette came a whisker away from denying me. \Are you sure you don't want, like, a Washington Apple or something?\"""" Baby girl, if I wanted a Washington Apple, I would let you know. Give me my Belvedere on ice, please. After some argument, she brought me my drink - and charged it to a complete stranger's tab.\n\nNow I don't mind a man occasionally picking up a few drinks, so long as he's at peace with the fact that I am (or was) an expensive drunk. However, this guy had no intention of buying me any drinks, and rather than quash an incredibly awkward situation, the waitress simply told me, \""""Well, I already put it on his tab. Maybe you can buy him a drink to even it out?\"""" Lovely suggestion, but way to not have any regard for the social discomfort you've caused me.\n\nBeyond that run-in, this place is just a nightmare. It takes way too long and costs far too much to maintain a decent buzz, and in the meantime you're not even filling up space with decent appetizers. Don't  even bother."""""""
We stopped in on a Friday night so I would not have to cook. I ordered the Roasted Turkey dinner with stuffing, mashed potatoes and cranberry. What they brought me was awful!! The first bite I had was a really  bad tasting meat with a greenish/yellow gravy. I had to spit it out in my napkin. The waitress was extremely nice and so was the manager and they did take it off of my bill, but I would have to say there is nothing homemade about this family restaurant. It was obvious that everything was from a can. The cost of our bill was too high for the quality of food. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place and we won't be coming back. It is really a shame that there isn't a good neighborhood restaurant in this area where someone can get some home cooking. I never expected it be gourmet, but seriously...this bad?
This place was a total waste of time.  My friend and I did a long bike ride, and found ourselves craving burgers.  We considered our options, and decided to go with Five Guys because it was close to my house, would give us  a chance to check out Cityscape, and our president famously ate there shortly after taking up residence in the White House.  I am SO not impressed.  I ordered the little burger, which is a single patty, and the fries.  I got way too many fries, and there wasn't any ranch dressing evident into which I could dip them.  So, I was not inclined to eat my fries at all.  The burger was ok.  The big sacks of potatoes in the middle of the restaurant was not appealing (pun intended).  The place was noisy; the music was too loud for conversation.  And the Cityscape development is lame.
Need more front office staff! Horrible customer service both on the phone and in person.  Both my appointments were 30-60mins late. One of my appointments they told me they were running about 1 hour behind. One person waiting told me that he was waiting 1 hour for just to get heartworm medicine. Everyone waiting seems really annoyed and you can tell they have been waiting a long time or they have not even been helped at all.  \nMy 2nd appointment I refused to wait 1 hour past MY appointment time. I told the front office lady that I was not able to wait. She was very smug with me and told me there was nothing she could do. So I walked out. \nMy first appointment my dog need to get some stitches out so whisked her away leaving me in the waiting area and in 2 mins brought her back and said they took them out saying everything looks good. There was no talking to the veterinarian. Is the veterinarian even looking at my dog??? I dont care how small my dogs cut is Im paying you $300 for all my visits and for a VET! Especially running a hour behind yup dont think she looked at him. I was really annoyed. \nThe staff seems like they over book patients (obviously) and I see all the parents in the waiting area. Doesnt seem to be any use of the exam rooms or interaction much with the veterinarian from what I see. \nI am disappointed  because this vet is close to the home but I much rather drive twice as far to have a on time appointment with a nicer more personable staff. \nI DO NOT recommend Banfield Hospital especially the one in Surprise. \nI will def be finding a nice neighborhood vet!
"""SHADY! SHADY! SHADY!!!!!\nMy friends car broke down and it was towed there. They were supposed to diagnose thye problem. They told her the alternator was bad and it would be $600 to replace it.

She informed Greulich`s that the car would be towed to a different shop to have the repair done. They told her the car was \in pieces\"""" and it would be $400 to put it back together.
